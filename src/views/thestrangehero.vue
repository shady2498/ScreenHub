<h1>The Strange Hero</h1>
<p>My Strange Hero (Korean: 복수가 돌아왔다; RR: Boksu-ga Dorawatda; lit. Bok-soo's Back) is a South Korean television series starring Yoo Seung-ho, Jo Bo-ah and Kwak Dong-yeon. It aired on SBS's Mondays and Tuesdays at 22:00 (KST) from December 10, 2018 to February 4, 2019.
In 2009, Kang Bok-soo is enrolled as a junior at Seolsong High, a prestigious private high school known for its discriminatory practice of segregating students based on their grades and social status. Bok-soo is a routine troublemaker who scores poorly in tests, but he is also popular for being a bully hunter. He dates the school's smartest student, Son Soo-jung, and is also best friends with Oh Se-ho, the awkward son of the school's abusive board chairwoman, Lim Se-gyeong. Soo-jung has long been hiding the fact that she is poor, but her background is suddenly outed to the school a day after she discloses it to Bok-soo, causing her to believe that he cares for her out of simple pity. When she heads to the roof to mourn, she hears Bok-soo and Se-ho having an argument, ending with the latter falling. Se-ho survives the incident and testifies that Bok-soo pushed him. Soo-jung, still heartbroken by Bok-soo's apparent betrayal, testifies against him as well, leading to his expulsion from Seolsong.
