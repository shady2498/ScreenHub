<h1>My Hero Academia</h1>
<p>My Hero Academia (Japanese: 僕のヒーローアカデミア, Hepburn: Boku no Hīrō Akademia) is a Japanese superhero manga series written and illustrated by Kōhei Horikoshi. It has been serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 2014, with its chapters additionally collected into 26 tankōbon volumes as of March 2020. The story follows Izuku Midoriya, a boy born without superpowers (called Quirks) in a world where they have become commonplace, but who still dreams of becoming a hero himself. He is scouted by All Might, Japan's greatest hero, who shares his quirk with Midoriya after recognizing his potential, and later helps to enroll him in a prestigious high school for heroes in training.
The manga was adapted into an anime television series by Bones. Its first season aired in Japan from April 3 to June 26, 2016, followed by a second season from April 1 to September 30, 2017, then a third season from April 7 to September 29, 2018, a fourth season from October 12, 2019 to April 4, 2020, and a fifth season has been announced. An animated film titled My Hero Academia: Two Heroes was released on August 3, 2018. A second animated film titled My Hero Academia: Heroes Rising was released on December 20, 2019. There are plans for a live-action film by Legendary Entertainment.
The series has been licensed for an English-language release by Viz Media and began serialization in their weekly digital manga anthology Weekly Shonen Jump on February 9, 2015. Shueisha began to simulpublish the series in English on the website and app Manga Plus in January 2019.
