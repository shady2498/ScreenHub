<h1>Attack On titan</h1>
<p>Attack on Titan (Japanese: 進撃の巨人, Hepburn: Shingeki no Kyojin, lit. "The Attack Giant") is a Japanese manga series both written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama. It is set in a fantasy world where humanity lives within territories surrounded by three enormous walls that protect them from gigantic man-eating humanoids referred to as Titans. The series first began in Kodansha's Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine on September 9, 2009, and it has been collected into 31 tankōbon volumes as of April 2020.

The manga has been adapted into an anime television series produced by Wit Studio (seasons 1 to 3) and MAPPA (season 4). The 25-episode first season was broadcast from April to September 2013. The 12-episode second season was broadcast from April to June 2017. The 22-episode third season was broadcast in two parts, with the first 12 episodes aired from July to October 2018 and the last 10 episodes aired from April to July 2019. The fourth and final season has been announced to premiere in October 2020.

Attack on Titan has become a critical and commercial success. As of December 2019, the manga has 100 million tankōbon copies in print worldwide,[5][6] making it one of the best-selling manga series. It has won several awards, including the Kodansha Manga Award,[7] the Micheluzzi Award,[8] and Harvey Award.[9] The anime series has also been well received by critics with the first three seasons being met with praise for its story, animation, music and voice acting, and has proved to be extremely successful in Japan, U.S., Europe and Asia, thus boosting the series' popularity. Although it has gained significant fame and popularity in Japan's neighbouring countries, political interpretations of the series have caused controversies in China and South Korea
