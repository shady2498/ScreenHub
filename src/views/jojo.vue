<h1>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</h1>
<p>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (Japanese: ジョジョの奇妙な冒険, Hepburn: JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki. Originally serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly seinen manga magazine Ultra Jump in 2005. The series is divided into eight story arcs or parts, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the "JoJo" nickname; the eighth part, JoJolion, began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. The series is Shueisha's second largest manga series by volume count, with its chapters collected in 127 tankōbon as of April 2020.
A 13-episode original video animation series adapting the manga's third part, Stardust Crusaders, was produced by A.P.P.P. and released between 1993 and 2002. The studio later produced an anime film adapting the first part in the series, Phantom Blood, which was released in theaters in 2007. In October 2012, a new anime television series adaptation of Phantom Blood produced by David Production began broadcast on Tokyo MX. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, Golden Wind, which ended broadcast in July 2019. A live-action film based on the manga's fourth part, Diamond Is Unbreakable, entered theaters in 2017.
