<h1>Black Clover</h1>
<p>Black Clover (Japanese: ブラッククローバー, Hepburn: Burakku Kurōbā) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yūki Tabata. It has been serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine since February 16, 2015, and has been collected into 23 tankōbon volumes. The story centers around Asta, a young boy seemingly born without any magic power, something that is unknown in the world he lives in. With his fellow mages from the Black Bulls, Asta plans to become the next Wizard King.

The manga has been adapted into an original video animation produced by Xebec Zwei, which was released in 2017, as well an anime television series produced by Pierrot, which also premiered in Japan in 2017.
