<h1>Cobra Kai</h1>
<p>Cobra Kai is an American action comedy-drama web television series, presented in an episodic storytelling format, and based on The Karate Kid film series. It was created by Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg, and Josh Heald, and stars Ralph Macchio and William Zabka (both of whom are reprising their roles from The Karate Kid, and who also serve as co-executive producers of the series) along with Xolo Maridue√±a, Courtney Henggeler, Tanner Buchanan and Mary Mouser. Cobra Kai is set 34 years after the original Karate Kid film, and re-examines the narrative from Johnny Lawrence's point of view (placing it within the "minor-character elaboration" genre).[1] His decision to reopen the Cobra Kai karate dojo leads to the rekindling of his old rivalry with Daniel LaRusso.

The first season was released on May 2, 2018 and the second season on April 24, 2019, both on YouTube Premium. On May 2, 2019, YouTube renewed the series for a third season,[2] which is scheduled for a 2020 release.[3] As of January 2020, the series premiere and the season 2 premiere have received over 80 million views on YouTube.
