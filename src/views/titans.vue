<h1>Titans</h1>
<p>Titans is an American web television series created by Akiva Goldsman, Geoff Johns, and Greg Berlanti for DC Universe. Based on the DC Comics team Teen Titans, the series depicts a group of young heroes who join forces in their fight against evil. Featured as members of the eponymous Titans are Dick Grayson (Brenton Thwaites), Kory Anders (Anna Diop), Rachel Roth (Teagan Croft), Gar Logan (Ryan Potter), Jason Todd (Curran Walters), Donna Troy (Conor Leslie), Dawn Granger (Minka Kelly), Hank Hall (Alan Ritchson), Rose Wilson (Chelsea Zhang), and Conner (Joshua Orpin).
A live-action series based on the Teen Titans entered development in September 2014 for the cable channel TNT, with Goldsman and Marc Haimes writing the pilot. The pilot had been ordered by December 2014, but never came to fruition, with TNT announcing in January 2016 it would no longer be moving forward with the project. In April 2017, it was announced that the series was being redeveloped for DC Universe as its first original scripted program with Goldsman, Johns, and Berlanti attached. Thwaites was cast as Grayson in September 2017, and other series regulars were cast between August and October 2017.
Titans premiered on October 12, 2018, and its first season comprised eleven episodes. A thirteen-episode second season premiered on September 6, 2019, and a third season is scheduled to premiere in 2020. Characters introduced in Titans later reappeared in the DC Universe series Doom Patrol, although Doom Patrol is set in a separate continuity.
