<h1>Beyblade</h1>
<p>Beyblade (diminutive Bey, from the diminutive of Beigoma) is a line of spinning top toys originally developed by Takara and manufactured by Tomy, first released in Japan in July 1999. The main premise of the series is that the beyblade is customizable, with interchangeable parts. Beyblade is now manufactured by many different companies including Hasbro.

Both the toys and their names were inspired by "Beigoma", a traditional spinning top. The concept is similar to Battling Tops, a board game developed by Ideal Toy Company in 1968. The toy line was introduced with an accompanying manga series of the same name in 1999. In 2002, Hasbro began to sell Beyblade toys internationally (under license from, and produced by, Takara) along with a coordinated country-by-country release of localized versions of the TV series. In August 2008, Takara Tomy released Beyblade: Metal Fusion; the first incarnation of the toy in three and a half years.

The Beyblade Burst series debuted in 2015, followed by Beyblade Burst Evolution, Beyblade Burst Turbo, and most recently Beyblade Burst Rise (known to Takara Tomy as Beyblade Burst GT).
